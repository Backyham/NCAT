## OpenAI Whisper

One of OpenAI's fabulous results, using heavy compute resource to prove Brute-Force Artificial Intellegence Development is avaliable, just need incredible amount of compute power.

Great recognition error rate, poor word-level timestamp, making timeline work needs a lot more human input.

Alternative Whisper implementation all focused on efficiency and process speed (to the point of live caption is possible). Accuracy depends on model size and quality, timestamp accuracy is not improved in the slightest.

stable-ts enhancement do in fact stables timestamp performance. But only improves stability, not accuracy.

Considering to give it up for timeline work.
