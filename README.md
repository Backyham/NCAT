# NCAT: Nick's Computer-Aided Translation Script Suite

This is a CAT solution to implement Nick's tailored video translation workflow.

Derived from Nixiesubs' workflow, using some Nixiesub codes and scripts. Special thanks to @dummyx, @kilo19 and fellow contributors.

Please consider this repo as a playground for me to play, try, test and learn automation and programming stuff, so forgive how entry-level this might appear.

## Plan

1. Part I: (Youtube) Video download automation (not implemented)
2. Part IIA: ASS auto generation (using Nixiesub's tools. Not implemented.)
3. Part IIB: ~~Feed Audio to Whisper ASR (Depolyed,~~ partially automated using Python).
    
    ~~To do I: Auto audio & low-res video proxy for timelining transcode~~(Implemented)

    To do II: explore enhancements/alternatives such as `stable-ts`, `whisperX`

    This part is the centerpiece, ~~and will be modulized for standalone operation (Might need some UI).~~ No need to be, using Whisper in CLI will be suffice. 
4. Part III: Implement a translataion workspace (Need to check out more CAT softwares, may base on Aegisub to incorporate timeline jobs. Long term improvements to be expected.)
5. Part IV: Video render with subtitles (Will base on NixieSubs' script, format and style). __Implemented, need more testing and fine tuning.__

Since I am a programming noob, this gonna take a long time.

But it might just seems to be very difficult. We'll see.
