# NCAT: Nick's Computer-Aided Translation

This is a CAT solution to implement Nick's tailored video translation workflow.

## Plan

1. Part I: (Youtube) Video download automation (not implemented)
2. Part II: Feed to Whisper ASR (Depolyed, not script-automated, not `stable-ts` enhanced). This part is the centerpiece, and will be modulized for standalone operation (UI needed then).
3. Part III: Implement a translataion workspace (Need to check out more CAT softwares, may base on Aegisub to incorporate timeline jobs. Long term improvements to be expected.)
4. Part IV: Video re-render with subtitles (Will base on NixieSubs' script, format and style)

Since I am a programming noob, this gonna take a long time.
