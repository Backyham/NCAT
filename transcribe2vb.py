'''
Transcribe video/audio to text file and VoiceBase-style json.
Powered by OpenAI Whisper Automatic Speech Recognition.
Special thanks to @dummyx for answering my newbie questions and his code.

A part of code in here is to transform Whisper JSON output to VoiceBase-Style JSON.
There's a historical reason behind this 
since this workflow is derived from Nixiesub, using Nixiesub tools.
And I, as of now, might not have the abillity to avoid this workaround.
Not before other tools have been reconstructed.
